# Welcome to my writing samples repo!

#### There are several examples of technical documentation listed here that you are free to browse!

Some Notes:

- The PDF files are an assortment of research papers, procedures, write-ups, and presentations.
- Within those files, there are examples of CAD designs, block diagrams, tables, and other figures that I have created along with the written portion.
- The markdown file is a snippet of instructions I wrote for work that I ported over from Microsoft Word.
- Some of the information is redacted because of its sensitive nature.

Enjoy! ðŸ˜„
