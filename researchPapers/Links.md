[A Multimodal-Sensor-Enabled Room for Unobtrusive Group Meeting Analysis](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3242969.3243022)

This paper studies group meeting dynamics and participants' posture and engagement. I personally analyzed data for visual focus of attention and audio transcriptions for smart room meetings using Python and Audacity. 
Using that data, I explored depth maps and segmenting to train algorithm to discern a relationship between body posture and more sociological traits such as leadership and personality.
I mainly contributed to sections 4 and 5 of the paper, and proofread the overall content. The International Conference on Multimodal Interaction accepted our paper in 2018.

This paper studies a new peripheral for Virtual Reality that can affect how users interact in a virtual space. I developed the hardware for the thermal feedback and part of the virtual environment in this study.
The writing is a collaboration between me and my partner.
